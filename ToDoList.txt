----------
- Update to use Maven
- Complete WhoLovesYou servlet
- Error log level for some of the places where exceptions happen (April 16, 2011)
- Add remaining required properties for test PST files (April 16, 2011)
- Add remaining properties not found in test PST files (April 16, 2011)
- Read in remaining property types (May 3, 2011)
- Throw exceptions for more unexpected conditions (May 3, 2011)

Done
----
- Update stale Javadoc documentation links
	Complete (November 6, 2019)

- Change package name to something better than com.jsoft
	Complete (November 3, 2019)

- Check in changes to compile under new versions of Java
	Complete (November 3, 2019)

- Host project externally (e.g. private repository on bitbucket) (April 16, 2011)
	Complete (November 3, 2019)

- XXBlocks (April 16, 2011)
	Complete, (April 16, 2011)

- XBlock/XXBlock in property context (April 16, 2011)
	Complete (April 16, 2011)

- TableContext issue where number of entries expected in an MULTIPLE_INTEGER_32 array is 492, but only 1 is found. (April 16, 2011)
	Fixed by implementing XXBlock processing (April 16, 2011)

- Rationalize logging (April 16, 2011)
	Complete (April 16, 2011)
	
- Make HeapOnNode.heap private (need to fix BTreeOnHeap) (May 3, 2011)
	Complete (May 3, 2011)

- Unrecognized node type exceptions in BTreeOnHeap and SubnodeBTree (April 16, 2011)
	Seems to have been fixed by correcting use of HID blockIndex and index, and using null when HID index is 0 (May 8, 2011)

- TableContext - exception reading TCInfo. (April 16, 2011)
	Seems to have been fixed by correcting use of HID blockIndex and index, and using null when HID index is 0 (May 8, 2011)

- HeapOnNode.FillLevel - what's it good for? (April 16, 2011)
	I don't think this is necessary for applications which only read PST files (May 8, 2011)

- Improve speed of HeapOnNode processing (April 16, 2011)
	This seems to be caused by the time required to display the results, e.g. HeapOnNode spends ~ 10:35 on output. (May 9, 2011)

- HeapOnNode - consilidate SimpleBlock and XBlock/XXBlock handling (May 9, 2011)
	Complete (June 12, 2011)

- Implement CRC calculation (and use) (April 16, 2011)
	Complete (August 21, 2011).
	Note that testing showed a byte-based implementation of the algorithm was faster than the reference version (based on 32-bit integers) and
	then a version based on 64-bit integers. This also permitted me to ditch 7 of the 8 look-uo tables. For reference, I've store the old version
	in the history folder.

- Complete javadoc (April 16, 2011)
	Oof! Completed on November 19, 2011

- PropertyContext - running out of heap space on huge buffer  - need to reduce memory footprint. (April 16, 2011)
	- Reduced to -Xmx75M by using StringBuilder and new read mechanism (it was -Xmx100M before using StringBuilder, and -Xmx94M 95 after)
	- Modified to use "proxy" indicating how to read in data from HNID, rather than always reading it in. It is now read on demand. (Naovmber 20, 2011)

- Create ANSI PST file for testing (April 16, 2011)
	Done and tested (Nov. 24, 2011)

- Create translator for cyclic encoding (need PST file) (April 16, 2011)
	coded but not tested, August 20, 2011
	Tested and debugged (Nov. 24, 2011)
