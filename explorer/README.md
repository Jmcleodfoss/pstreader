# Explorer
A Swing application for looking at PST files on any platform that supports Java.

The PST library is a memory hog; you may need to increase the available heap to read some PST files.

## Windows cmd
    java -cp target\explorer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

## Linux, Cygwin
    java -cp target/explorer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
